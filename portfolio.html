          <p>'Terry' is a small drone that guards the inside of a homeowner's house when they are not home. The drone monitors the inside of the house by slowly flying around the house whilst producing "home noises" such as people talking or a dog barking. The audio from the drone aims to create a presence in the home in order to deter burglars from even entering the home. There is also an app interface that Homeowners can use as a way of interacting with the Terry drone whilst they are not home. Homeowners will be alerted by the drone via the app if Terry identifies a potential threat in the home. There is also a camera attached to Terry which monitors the house and thus the homeowner can see what the drone sees via the app. </p>

          <p>The app is also accessible to neighbours and police. Neighbours will also be notified if their neighbour has a potential threat in their home. The purpose of this is to create awareness in the neighbourhood and remind the people to be cautious. Police will only be notified if the homeowner decides to send an SOS emergency to the police.

          <h3>Overview of Design Process</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">

          <p>Throughout our design process, our team undertook several iterations of ideas and research in order to create an efficient app interface and reliable autonomous drone. The topic of 'home security' was chosen because we believed we could further iterate on already existing autonomous products that are used for the protection of the home. We conducted several interviews, surveys, and design methods in order to gather important data and identify key issues and opportunities to focus on. The two themes we chose to put strong emphasis on was "scaring the burglar" and "a presence in the home". These themes were chosen because we aimed to completely prevent burglars from entering the home.</p>
<br/><br/>
          <h4>Concept Development</h4>
          <p>During our ideation process, we brainstormed concepts and ideas we could potentially pursue. Initially we came up with four concepts: Beehive Idea, Roomba Idea, Marbles Idea, Flower Idea</p>

          <div class="col-md-12">
                <div id="carouselExampleIndicators2" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">

                    <li data-target="#carouselExampleIndicators2" data-slide-to="2"></li>
                    <li data-target="#carouselExampleIndicators2" data-slide-to="3"></li>
                  </ol>
                  <div class="carousel-inner">
                    <div class="carousel-item active">
                      <img class="d-bloc w-100" src="./img/process-journal/carousel-images1/213.jpg?auto=yes&bg=777&fg=555&text=First slide" alt="First slide">

                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <a class="carousel-control-prev" href="#carouselExampleIndicators2" role="button" data-slide="prev">
                    <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
                    <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
                  </a>
                  <a class="carousel-control-next" href="#carouselExampleIndicators2" role="button" data-slide="next">
                    <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
                    <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
                  </a>
                </div>                
           
   
  <br/> <br/> <br/> 

   <p>From our four initial concepts, we decided to iterate further on our ‘Roomba’ and ‘Beehive’ concepts. Regarding the Roomba concept, our group liked the idea of a drone monitoring the inside of the house without anyone home. Same idea with the Beehive concept except, the drones are monitoring the outside of the house.</p>

              <div class="col-md-6">
                <img src="./img/process-journal/outdoor.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                <span class="img-caption">OUTDOOR DRONE CONCEPT</span>
              </div>

                   <div class="col-md-6">
                <img src="./img/process-journal/indoor.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                <span class="img-caption">INDOOR DRONE CONCEPT</span>
              </div>
            </div>

            <br/><br/>

          <p>We decided to choose our 'INDOOR DRONE CONCEPT' as we believed it suited our goal of “a presence in the home” so that burglars won’t even attempt to intrude in on the home. We believed that the outdoor concept was impractical as we came up with reasonings such as, “what if it starts raining? Where will the drones be kept when they are not deployed?” We liked the idea of a drone that produces audio whilst simultaneously monitoring the home as it was not only securing the house, but also creating a presence in the home.</p>
<br/><br/>
        <h4>Creation of Prototypes</h4>

        <p>We created two interfaces based on our indoor concept. Our group used paper prototypes to display two interfaces based on our "indoor concept" in order to show the basic foundation of what each interface would look like and how it would function. The two interfaces were an 'App' and a 'Smart Speaking System'.</p>
<br/><br/>
        <h5>Paper Prototype: The App</h5>
        <p>Our team decided to create an App interface because we believed it was easy for users to access wherever they were.</p>
            <img src="./img/process-journal/carousel-images2/app-paper1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
            <br/> <br/>
            <img src="./img/process-journal/carousel-images2/app-paper2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">

<br/><br/><br/>
            <h6>Scenario of a homeowner using the app interface</h6>
            <p>Storyboards were used as it provided our team with a visual walkthrough of what the user could potentially experience as they use our interfaces. It helps us understand the main areas of when, why and how users would interact with our interface in the given scenario. 
            <center><img src="./img/process-journal/carousel-images2/appstoryboard.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"></center>

<br/><br/><br/>
        <h5>Paper Prototype: Smart Speaking System</h5>
        <p>We decided to create a smart speaking system because we believed that it would potentially be more convenient for the user and more fitting with the rise of artificial intelligence in society.</p>

            <center><img src="./img/process-journal/speakingstoryboard.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"></center>

<br/> <br/> <br/> 
            <h5>Notification Screens</h5>
            <p>These are notification screens the homeowner, neighbours and police will see.</p>
            <img src="./img/process-journal/notificationpaper.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"> 


<br/><br/><br/>
            <h5>User Testing: Paper Prototypes</h5>
            <p>User testing was a key activity that our team underwent throughout our design process. This was a repeated activity that we conducted for our interface development as it provided us with the most effective information for us to iterate and improve our concept. For our user testing of our paper prototypes, we used various methods in order to obtain feedback for our prototypes. We used contextual observation because we were able to observe the overall experience the user was going through as they interacted with our interfaces. Think Aloud method was used as it allowed us to gain the users initial feedback, opinions and thoughts whilst using the product. Finally, we used A/B Testing to allow the user to compare the two interfaces and state their opinions on the pros and cons of both interfaces. </p>

            <h5>Choosing our interface</h5>
            <p>After analysing our user testing feedback, we made the decision to pursue our 'App' concept. From our user testing, we believed that we had more opportunities to effectively iterate on this concept rather than the Smart Speaking System. The user testing feedback also provided us with important insights into new elements that need to be included, aspects of the app that need changing, and removing elements that are not useful. These changes were applied into our wireframes.</p>

            <h6>Why use wireframes?</h6>
            <p>Wireframes were used to provide a more thorough and detailed version of the previous paper prototypes. The interface was also created digitally to give us a better understanding of what the overall aesthetic would potentially look like on a mobile phone</p>

<br/><br/><br/><br/>
            <h5>Terry App Wireframes</h5>

              <img src="./img/process-journal/userflow.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
<br/><br/><br/>
             <h5>User Testing: Wireframes</h5>
             <p>We user tested our wireframes once again to gather more feedback in order to improve our interface. Our group conducted the same methods to obtain feedback and some key themes we needed to focus on were:</p>
             <p><li>More clarity in what certain icons mean in the interface</li></p>
             <p><li>Giving an option for the user to manage the drone in order to give the user more control</li></p>
             <p><li>Requiring a more convenient and simplified way of navigating through the app</li></p>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
            <h5>High Fidelity Prototype</h5>
            <p>The wireframes were transferred to a program called 'Figma'. We used this program as it allowed all the members in our team to simultaneously work on our high fidelity prototype. As seen below, it reveals the progressive change and improvement the app underwent such as aesthetics, layout and function. We used the gradient blue background to create a clean and modern look to our app. We also blended it with a house illustration to keep with the topic of "home security".</p>

           <h5>User Testing: High Fidelity Prototype</h5>

           <p><li>The need for confirmation when doing certain tasks on the app</li></p>
           <p><li>Needing more information about how to add members in the family and community sections</li></p>
           <p><li>Users liked the idea of being able to control the drone to move to other areas in the home</li></p>
           <p><li>Users were able to understand what most elements meant</li></p>
           <p><li>The Live Feed section was the section that users liked and were interested in</li></p>

           <h5>Iterations of the Final Prototype</h5>

             <p><strong>We included a "confirmation" tick, in order to give users reassurance of completing certain tasks within the app.</strong></p>

          <h3>Reflection of Process</h3>
          <p>From this design process, a key activity that I learnt and found utmost importance in was user testing. Without reaching out to users, creating a useful, practical and effective concept is extremely difficult to execute. Upon my experience in this, our group were able to pin point specific issues and patterns that were addressed during the user testing. Thus we were able to take this into action by implementing changes and iterating our design to suit the needs of the user better. Our final prototype is an aesthetic and simple to follow app that has aided the needs we identified throughout our whole user testing in our design process.</p>
